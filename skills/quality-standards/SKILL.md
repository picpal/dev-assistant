# Quality Standards Skill

Best practices and coding standards for maintaining high-quality, maintainable code.

## Purpose

Provide language-specific guidelines for writing clean, maintainable, and production-ready code.

## Coverage

- **Java/Spring Boot**: SOLID principles, Spring patterns, enterprise patterns
- **Python**: PEP 8, Pythonic code, type hints
- **TypeScript/React**: TypeScript best practices, React patterns

## Reference Files

- `java-best-practices.md`: Java and Spring Boot coding standards
- `python-best-practices.md`: Python style guide and best practices
- `typescript-best-practices.md`: TypeScript and React patterns

## Key Principles

1. SOLID principles
2. DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
3. KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)
4. YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)
5. Code for readability

## Integration with Code-Quality Agent

Provides standards that the `code-quality` agent uses when analyzing code and suggesting refactorings.
